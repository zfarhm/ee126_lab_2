Cache Simulator Assignment
--------------------------

In this assignment you will design a basic cache simulator.

Cache specifications are passed from command line. The specifications include
cache size, associativity and block size. Both cache size and block size are
specified in bytes. Along with cache specifications, an input file is passed
that has read and write commands with associated address and data values in hex
format. 

The provided top level 'cacheSim.cc' reads command line parameters, parses the
inputs, and calls appropriate methods of your base cache to perform required
operations.

A skeleton BaseCache class is also provided. You are required to fill it
to complete the assignment. For your ease, all the methods and variables
that you need to write are labelled with 'WRITE ME'.

Use Makefile provided to compile the assignment. 

Command to run the cache simulator (for 512B cache, associativity 2 and
block size of 16bytes) is :
	./cacheSim 512 2 16 input1.txt
Sample input and output files are provided. Output files are generated for above
cache specifications.

You will implement LRU policy for cache line replacement for read and write
misses. 

For a write miss you write data to LRU cache line and update its tag.Upon
read miss, typically we fetch data from lower cache levels or main memory and
replace the LRU cache line with new data. However, for this part of the
assignment as we don't ask you to implement cache hierarchy, update only tag of
the LRU cache line and leave the data untouched. 

WRITE MISS
** did not see the tag in the cache at all
** find the LRU cache and evict
-write tag/data to the evicted block
-update LRU vector

WRITE HIT
**found the specific tag in the cache set we are looking in
-replace the data with the provided data
-update LRU vector

READ MISS
** cant find the data I want
** find the LRU cache, but DONT EVICT
-write just the tag to this selected block
-update LRU vector

READ HIT
** found the specific tag in the cache set we are looking in
-return the data
-update LRU vector

Assumptions:
1. Writes and reads are always 32bits long.
2. Block Size is always multiple of 4 bytes.
3. Read and Write addresses are 32bit aligned. This removes the necessity to
check for any partial data availability.
